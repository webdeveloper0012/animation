# animation
html/css animation.
Here I used SCSS.
 When you sue VS code. 
 First, you need to install "Live Sass Compiler".
 
 Then, you can look at "watching at the bottom of the VS code editor".
 Clicking it, you can right click on html.index file to click "Open with Live Server" on the popup menu.
 Once you click "Watching" SCSS file is compiled to Native Css file so the browser can read.
 Html file uses CSS file compiled from SCSS file.
